# ML_Luna16_grandchallenge_lung_nodule_detection

##### The dataset can be found in the Luna16 challenge

## Given the dataset for the size of Hippocampus and Enthorhinal we will make a model that predicts the class of the nodule

### The train dataset, where each collumn shows particular segments of the lung find meaningfull data's

### The test dataset, use it for evaluation
